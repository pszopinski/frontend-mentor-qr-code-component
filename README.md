## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

You can request specific, discrete font weights using the Google Fonts API, like so:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap");
```

I doubt such optimisation makes real difference. Regarless, ideally such optimisation should be done automatically by the tooling that analyses fonts and their variants in use in the project.

### Continued development

I can imagine adding a link to the QR code with hover and active animations, to make the website more useful for computer users.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts API documentation](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2#individual_styles_such_as_weight) - I learned how to request specific font weights of a variable font there.
